"""A GP prior is an MvNormal over stacked inputs.

The design commitment: `GP` is a thin constructor, not a new distribution and
not an object that owns inference. Everything downstream (marginalization,
conditionals, posterior predictive) is the generic linear-Gaussian machinery in
`pymc_extras.model.marginal`, which knows nothing about GPs.

Partitioning uses stock `pt.pack` / `pt.unpack`: define the prior jointly over
every input set you care about (training points, prediction points, inducing
points), then "observed at the training points" is just `f_train`, a slice.
Slicing is affine, which is all the marginalization needs.

`packed_shapes` are symbolic graphs, not plain sizes, and when a part is a
`pm.Data` they reference that shared variable. Every pymc model transform goes
through `clone_model`, which clones shared variables, so shapes taken from the
original model keep reading the original model's data. Re-derive them against
the transformed model -- `pt.pack(X, cond_m["X_pred"], keep_axes=-1)` -- before
unpacking anything that came out of `marginalize` or `conditional`.
