    The inner graph of a MarginalRV is generative: it draws the marginalized

    Parameters
    ----------
    op : MarginalRV
        The marginal op whose marginalized variable is being conditioned.
    inputs : Sequence[Variable]
        Replacements for the node inputs, already expressed in the caller's
        target graph.
    dep_rvs : Sequence[Variable]
        The variables the dependents are conditioned on (model variables or
        observed data), one per dependent output.

    Returns
    -------
    Variable
        A random variable distributed as ``p(marginalized | dependents, inputs)``,
